        <h1>Country of Birth</h1>
				<h4>By Sex</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Define a Mesh Block, SA1: Now if someone had given me a task like this last year, I probably would have made Pomodoro sauce, splashed it onto some Penne and served it to a customer only to be told “Ummmm I asked for bacon and eggs with lightly buttered sourdough?!” (Insert confused look here).
<br>
<br>
        My mesh block is with NSW and focuses on the Country of Birth by Total and divided by sex (Male and Female). Australia is defined as a multicultural country and as you can imagine, there are tonnes of Kebab shops and Chinese restos scattered around NSW. I do wonder what ever happened to those fabulous Mom and Pop corner stores that served those homemade style burger and chips with chicken salt … my youth!
<br>
<br>
        I have chosen to focus on on 3 regions of the world Europe, Middle East and Asia. From those regions I have chosen the following.</p>

        <h3>Total Personal Income Weekly</h3>
        <p>“Hey Louie, Hey Louie … but what are you comparing this to” … for those in the back, I’m comparing it to ‘Total Personal Income by area’. Do I need to address the elephant in the room? Of course I fucking do! Women get paid less than men and I don’t need no data to show me that truth. However … it helps paint a picture. So the more vibrant the colour the more money people have in that area</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What is Data Journalism?</h2>
        <p>
        The only thing in the above heading that jumps at me is ‘Journalism’. I’m immediately transported to the movie ‘Spy Game’ with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. I’m sure everyone has at some point fantasised about being a spy doubling as a photojournalist and bedding a gorgeous aid worker … anyone, anyone … ok just me then?
        <br>
        <br>
        Data Journalism combines traditional journalism with a range of digital information, then using those elements to tell a compelling story. Programming automated data gathering, Using software to find data connections between hundreds of thousands of documents; these are just a couple examples of how technology can be used to aid in ‘Data Journalism’. A great example of Data Journalism can be found here <a href="https://medium.economist.com/an-anatomy-of-murder-20ef83346d37">Read More</a>

        <h2>The Dataset</h2>
        <p>
        I have been given “Country of Birth by sex” as a dataset and have found it interesting to see how people have chosen where to live. You have the Germans who live predominantly inland and the Chinese who favor close proximity to businesses. Based on data alone it tells me what nationalities and cultures value the most. As the "Legend" is lacking, the more Vibrant the colour, the more people reside in that area.
        <br>
        <br>
        What would be interesting to see is the reasons behind peoples living choices; Close to their jobs, community based decisions, safety factors etc.</p>
